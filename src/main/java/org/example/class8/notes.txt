Break Keyword:
Break keyword breaks a loop. We always use breaks with if conditions.
    Once the condition is met, it stops the loop even if it has more iterations.
Why should we break?
    If we break we eliminate a lot of unnecessary processing by terminating the loop
once the goal is complete.
Continue:
    Save resources. Continue is used to skip unnecessary calculations. If the element
meets the condition the element is skipped
Why should we use?
    save resources.
Note: Break and continue are always written with if conditions inside the loop.

Break completely breaks the loop!
Continue skips iteration! Not the entire loop
