Loops:
    Loops help us repeat a block of code until a condition fails.
    There are 4 main types of loops in Java.
While loop:   BEST for String
    When we don't know the number of iterations beforehand, while loop
    is the best type in that scenario. Does not require a number! It requires boolean.
    For example, when we search for a product in Amazon. We keep clicking next
    button until we find it.
Do While loop:
    When we want to execute the body of the loop at least once, BEFORE we check the condition
    that's when we should use the Do While loop!
For Loop:
    For is better choice when we know the number of iterations in advance.
    For example, we want to print 10 times.
Arrays: A collection of multiple variables. Every number is given a number called
    an index, that we can use to access that variable.
