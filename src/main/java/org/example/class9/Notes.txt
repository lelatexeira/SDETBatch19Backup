Arrays:
    Arrays are collections of multiple variables. These variables have indexes
    which help us retrieve and store data inside an array.
Why should we have arrays:
    When we have a lot of data storing it inside variables is not feasible.
Syntax:
Approach 1
    Datatype [] ArrayName= new DataType[];
    int[] numbers=new int[5];
    Approach 2:
    Datatype [] ArrayName= {element1,element2,element3,element4}
    int [] numbers={10,20,30,45,50};
Enhanced for loop:
    for(num:numbers)
    Enhanced for loop is simplified version of normal for loop, where elements
    are pulled from the array automatically one by one. There is no index involved
    in this type of loop. ALWAYS USE WHEN POSSIBLE
Nested Loops:
    Nested loop inside another loop
Why do we need Nested Loops?
