OOPS- Object Oriented Programming System
    It's just a way of writing code. Like we have many techniques of fighting(Kung Fu), we
    have many techniques to write large amounts of code.
Why should we learn OOPs?
    1) Helps us reduce the code duplications.
    2) Helps write dynamic code(same code doing different things).
    3) Helps write Modular code.
    4) It helps write secure code.
Class:
    A Class represents objects which have similar properties and behavior.
    We use these classes to create things quickly and efficiently.
    It's like a design/blueprint that helps us build objects quickly.
