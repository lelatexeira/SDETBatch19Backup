Notes:
1)We can click the starting bracket to check the ending
bracket, IntelliJ will highlight the ending bracket.
2) We can double-click inside any condition to highlight all the code
under the condition.
3) We can make shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+l(Windows) or Cmd+Alt+l(Mac) to
nicely format our code.

Type Casting:
Type Casting is moving the data from one data type to another.
When we move something from a small data type to a large data type
large data type it's called auto/widening/implicit.
When we move something from a bigger data type to a smaller box it is called
manual/narrowing/explicit.
Data types from small to large:
1) byte
2) short
3) int
4) long
5) float
6) double
When should we use typecasting?
When we combine the code from different sources we might
need to perform this type casting to make the code
compatible.
Relational Operators:
Relational Operators help us compare data. They always return the results in
the form of either True or False.
