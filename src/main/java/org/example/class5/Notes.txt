Scanner class:
    Scanner is a class that helps us take input data from the user to the keyboard.
    Just like Scanner class we have so many other classes we can use from Java and
    other libraries.
    These classes are divided into methods, each method can do something useful.
    LIke, nextInt(), nextBoolean(), nextDouble()
Important note:
    Every class in Java also acts as a data type. We can create
    variables of these classes.
    If we want to reuse some codes from a class. We can create its objects,
    and then we can call those methods.

    1)Logical NOT "!"
    2)Logical or "||"
    3)Logical and "&&"
